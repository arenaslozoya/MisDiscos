      <p>I was not a Demi fan previously as I was just not familiar with her. Sorry Not Sorry was my jam this summer so I decided to look her up on You Tube and fell down the rabbit hole that is Demi (and also realized I was familiar with some of her previous work). Now I am a fan for sure. I love every song and do not skip over any, which is very unusual. The lyrics are so good. Demi's voice is amazing!</p>

    <p>  originally bought the CD because I love the song Sorry Not Sorry but as I listened to the other songs I realize there's a lot of them on there I really like which is great because sometimes I buy CDs and only end up liking two or three songs and skip over the rest but on this CD I actually listen to it all the way through which is awesome!! The one I bought is explicit but I did not see an option for the clean version since I have a 9 year old and some of the songs I have to skip over when he's in the car because of the language. Other than that I love the CD! This is my first CD of Demi Lovato's and it won't be my last! I also love that with Amazon I actually got the songs on the CD downloaded to all of my Amazon apps before I received the CD. I love that when I buy a CD from Amazon I don't have to have my CDs with me to actually listen to them because it's on my Amazon app on my phone and laptop which is a big plus. </p>

  <p>Really like this CD, more than I had expected. Not all of it is great, but worth the money and it has some really good songs. Not as 'pop' as I had expected.</p>
