<p>Madison was born on March 5, 1999, in Jericho, New York, United States. She was born to an interior designer mother Tracie Beer and a father, Robert Beer who is a luxury home builder. Her parents are Jewish descendants. Madison, alongside her younger brother Ryder began to face the rough side of life after their parents separated and their father re-married.

This was after she finished schooling at ‘Jericho Middle School’. She is good with musical instruments like Piano, Drums, and guitar. In 2012, Madison published more of her music record on her YouTube page. Among the songs she published was her cover of Etta James’ At Last which caught the attention of the Canadian pop star Justin Bieber who in return shared a link of her song on his twitter handle, declaring how amazing her vocals was.</p>
